                    <p>I am a very creative and unquiet person.</p>
                    <p>I have lived in three different countries: Spain, Brazil and Malta, so I can speak fluently spanish, english and brazilian. Anyway, I love to travel, meet people and discover new cultures and traditions.</p>
                    <p>I like music, photography, collage, esculpture and any kind of art and craft stuff.</p>
                    <p>My first contact with technologies began with a ZX Spectrum 48k at the 80’s. When I was 9 years old I took a course on Basic with Ms-DOS and the “ide” gwBasic. I saved my code in a maravellous 5 1/4 floppy disk, although I hadn’t got any computer at that time, so I “copy/paste” my code , from my notebook papers to my brother’s Casio calcultor he used for university. Next yerar I would get my first computer, an Olivetti 386DX.</p>
                    <p>But I was just a child and I prefered playing Monkey Island rather than writing kilometric pokes. Years gone by and I got my Pentium 100 and enough power for starting with what took years of entartaiment: Paint Shop Pro, Corel  and 3D Studio (I still have that mitic black book from Anaya).</p>
                    <p>I was working as amateur with graphic software since 1995, I started using Photoshop in 1998, and in my first professional job as a creative and graphic designer, I created over 200 logos in 4 months.</p>
                    <p>That year I was coursing a 1000 hours dual training course, that included XHTML, HTML, JS, Flash (yes, with ActionScript) among other disciplines, and I also coded a little in the job.</p>
                    <p>During the dual training and the job I was decided to became a good graphic designer, but when I finished it, I started to deep in into the HTML and the CSS. The HTML5 and CSS3 was boiling at that time, and I could make a lot of graphic effects very fast with a few lines of CSS. Months later, when I was playing Monkey Island (yes, I still play that game once per year), I quitted the game because I thought something funny for doing with CSS. In that momment I realized that coding was funnier than playing videogames, and it would be awesome to make a living in that way. So I started diving and diving into theweb technologies from those days till today.</p>
